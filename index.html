        <p class="tradition"><strong>Tradition since 1889</strong></p>
        <p class="about-para">Catering refers to a service that delivers food to a client's location, and may also cook and serve it on site. Options range from full-service caterers that cook, deliver, set up and serve at an event to mobile or industrial caterers.A caterer provides hot or cold food to clients at a remote location. The food offer could be anything from hot gourmet meals prepared on-site to buffet food served in chafing dishes or party platters of cheese, meats and snacks.Catering companies send servers, chefs and other employees to the site for black tie parties, conventions and other events. A small office party may only require cold food, beverages and furniture or equipment rental without catering employees on premises â€” caterers tend to be very flexible with service.</p>
<p class="about-para">A catering service may have its own cooks to prepare food, or it may obtain food from a contractor or third party to deliver to the client. For sit-down dining events, the service usually sends waiters, waitresses and busboys to prepare tables and serve meals. For buffets and informal parties, the caterer may send employees to set up chafing dishes, bowls and platters full of food, replenish them and serve food to attendees.For banquet hall events and wedding receptions, a manager will generally direct the wait staff and supporting employees, such as coat check persons. Prior to the event, a sales representative helps the client choose food, venue and decorations within his price range and sets up the billing method. The client reviews an event proposal package with projected costs. Catering services usually require a deposit before the event.</p>
